# Users-Posts-App

This coding challenge is a small Vue.js and Vuex.js single page application showing user posts using a REST API with the possibility of expanding or deleting content. The app uses pagination, so only 10 posts are shown per page.


## Run locally

First, run the development server:

bash

npm install

npm run serve


Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.

The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
